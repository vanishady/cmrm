# Computer Music Representation and Models

This repo features just a couple CMRM projects I made with my project buddy, specifically:
- *genre recognition* task, using machine learning tecniques to build a functional algorithm for retrieving genre with some accuracy
- *source separation* task, using algebraic maths to achieve source sepatation in four different pitch ranges

Both are coded in **Python** and explained in a relative **report**.
